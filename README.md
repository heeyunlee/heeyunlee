### üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Heeyun Lee

<br>
<br>


## About
I'm a recent-grad at Pace University, majoring in Finance and Business Analytics. While I learned R, SQL, Excel, and Python in school, I also did multiple projects with Flutter and really enjoy creating really cool mobile applications.

  - What is [Business Analytics], anyway?
    - In short, I learned a little bit of everything from business and finance to statistics and data modeling. It gave me foundational knowledge regarding many concepts such as predictive modeling, data mining, and data visualization.

### More About Me
- ü™ñ I served in the Republic of Korea Marine Corps as a Signal Corpsman for two years.
